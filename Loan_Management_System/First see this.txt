This is a project on Loan Management System. There are 4 panels(LINKS) on index1.html page
1. Apply for Loan
2. Admin Login      (id=aman, password=gauri)
3. Company Registration
4. Company Login

Apply for loan is the register.html page in which user will enter the details and will
get an email notification.

Admin login is the admin.html page in which admin can perform all the crud operation

Company Registration is the company.html page which company can register his/her company
will get an email notification

Company Login is where the company will login and see which users have applied for the loan
and get them approve
